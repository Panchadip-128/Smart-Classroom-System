## Architecture Overview

This system introduces a continuous spatial-temporal methodology for strict physical attendance tracking in large-scale educational institutions (Universities, College Campuses). Built to scale to **10,000+ students**, we replace static snapshot-based facial recognition with a multi-layered, continuously accumulating presence engine that integrates ten distinct technical innovations into a single, edge-optimized pipeline.

The core pipeline operates asynchronously using ThreadPool concurrency: a video frame is captured, validated against environmental sensors, passed through a YOLOv8 body-detection liveness gate, processed by a facial recognition layer, fused with iris and voice biometric signals via a Kalman filter, and finally credited to an Accumulated Active Presence (AAP) counter. Every state change is logged to a tamper-evident blockchain audit trail and accompanied by a zero-knowledge proof.

## Enterprise Dashboard & Reporting

The system provides a comprehensive React-based UI for university administrators, professors, and students. It is heavily optimized to handle large datasets.

### 1. Central Administrator & Teacher Dashboard
The live tracking engine processes camera streams without blocking the asynchronous web server. Teachers can visually track Accumulated Active Presence (AAP) progression.

### 2. Student Data Management (10k+ Scale)
A dedicated lookup portal allows administrators or students to instantly pull historical attendance records across the entire semester.

### 3. Multi-Sheet Excel Export Engine
Designed for university registrars, the system generates comprehensive official `.xlsx` reports containing:
1.  **Today's Session:** Active metrics for the current class.
2.  **Full Attendance History:** Granular chronological logs.
3.  **Per-Student Summaries:** Aggregates total classes, attendance rate %, and average biometric certainty scores.
4.  **Daily Class Summaries:** High-level university metrics.
5.  **Blockchain Audit Trail:** The immutable hash-chain.

## Novel Modules

Here is a detailed visual breakdown of how each patented feature is practically applied in the system:

| Module | Feature | Technical Implementation & Application |
|--------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| **1. Two-Stage YOLO Liveness** | Anti-spoofing body-gated face detection | **Application:** YOLOv8n first detects a human person and checks aspect-ratio constraints. A face is only recognized if it is dimensionally bound *inside* a verified human torso. |
| **2. Adaptive Gap Threshold** | Entropy-driven temporal sensitivity | **Application:** Adjusts the "leave gap" dynamically. MediaPipe Pose extracts 33 body keypoints. A sliding-window entropy computation maps movement patterns to per-student dynamic gap thresholds. |
| **3. Model Hash Attestation** | Tamper-proof model loading | **Application:** SHA-256 cryptographic hashes of all model weights (e.g., `yolov8n.pt`, `yolov8n.onnx`) are verified at startup against a sealed registry. |
| **4. Zero-Knowledge Proofs** | Privacy-preserving presence verification | **Application:** A Pedersen commitment scheme generates ZK proofs for each 5-second presence window. |
| **5. Edge-Only Inference** | Hardware camera deployment | **Application:** Downscales inputs to 640px and natively loads ONNX quantized models via OpenCV/ONNXRuntime for deployment on Jetson Nanos. |
| **6. Policy-as-Code DSL** | Runtime-configurable attendance rules | **Application:** A domain-specific language parser loads `policy.dsl` at startup, enabling administrators to hot-reload time thresholds without restarting servers. |
| **7. Federated Learning** | On-device anti-spoof improvement | **Application:** Edge devices locally train a logistic classifier on genuine/spoof detections and upload only weight deltas. |
| **8. Blockchain Audit Log** | Immutable event ledger | **Application:** An append-only SHA-256 hash-chain records every state change. Any retrospective tampering breaks the chain. |
| **9. Environmental Gating** | Context-aware validation | **Application:** Ambient light (lux) and temperature (Celsius) sensor readings gate AAP accumulation. |
| **10. Session Recovery** | Biometric continuity after gaps | **Application:** Re-links post-gap detections to existing sessions using cosine similarity of stored face embeddings. |
