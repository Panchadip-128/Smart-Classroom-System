## Architecture Overview

This system introduces a continuous spatial-temporal methodology for strict physical attendance tracking in educational institutions. We replace static snapshot-based facial recognition with a multi-layered, continuously accumulating presence engine that integrates ten distinct technical innovations into a single pipeline.

The core pipeline operates as follows: a video frame is captured, validated against environmental sensors, passed through a YOLOv8 body-detection liveness gate, processed by a facial recognition layer, fused with iris and voice biometric signals via a Kalman filter, and finally credited to an Accumulated Active Presence (AAP) counter that enforces contiguous attendance. Every state change is logged to a tamper-evident blockchain audit trail and accompanied by a zero-knowledge proof of presence.

## Teacher and Student Dashboard

The system provides a comprehensive React-based UI for both teachers and students, enabling real-time tracking, historical analysis, and official reporting.

### For Teachers

*   **Live Tracking Dashboard:** View real-time Accumulated Active Presence (AAP) for all students. A progress bar visualizes progression towards the required 40-minute threshold.
*   **Continuous Camera Tracking:** Start and stop 3-second interval continuous tracking directly from the UI, with live YOLO vision output.
*   **End-of-Day Finalization:** A single click freezes the daily record, converting "In Progress" statuses to "Present", "Partial", or "Absent" based on the accumulated time.
*   **Multi-Sheet Excel Export:** Generate comprehensive official reports containing:
    *   Today's Session stats.
    *   Full Attendance History.
    *   Per-Student Summaries (total classes, attendance rate, avg biometric score).
    *   Daily Class Summaries.
    *   Blockchain Audit Trail.

### For Students

*   **Student Profile Lookup:** Search for a student name to view their complete attendance history, attendance rate, and biometric scores.
*   **Personal Excel Reports:** Students can download their own localized `.xlsx` attendance history for their records.

## The 10 Novel Modules

Here is a detailed breakdown of how each patented feature is practically applied in the system:

| Module | Feature | Technical Implementation & Application |
|--------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| **1. Two-Stage YOLO Liveness** | Anti-spoofing body-gated face detection | **Application:** Prevents "photo-to-camera" spoofing. YOLOv8n first detects a human person and checks aspect-ratio constraints. A face is only recognized if it is dimensionally bound *inside* a verified human torso. |
| **2. Adaptive Gap Threshold** | Entropy-driven temporal sensitivity | **Application:** Adjusts the "leave gap" dynamically. MediaPipe Pose extracts 33 body keypoints. A sliding-window entropy computation maps movement patterns to per-student dynamic gap thresholds (e.g., 5s for still students, 15s for active ones). |
| **3. Model Hash Attestation** | Tamper-proof model loading | **Application:** Guarantees inference integrity. SHA-256 cryptographic hashes of all model weights (e.g., `yolov8n.pt`) are verified at startup against a sealed registry, preventing unauthorized model substitution. |
| **4. Zero-Knowledge Proofs** | Privacy-preserving presence verification | **Application:** Privacy-compliant attendance. A Pedersen commitment scheme generates ZK proofs for each 5-second presence window. Third-party auditors can verify attendance without ever seeing raw video data. |
| **5. Edge-Only Inference** | Hardware camera deployment | **Application:** Low-power edge deployment. Includes an ONNX export script with INT8 quantization, allowing the heavy YOLO/dlib pipeline to run on Jetson Nanos or Coral TPUs directly. |
| **6. Policy-as-Code DSL** | Runtime-configurable attendance rules | **Application:** Zero-downtime policy updates. A domain-specific language parser loads `policy.dsl` at startup, enabling administrators to hot-reload time thresholds, confidence levels, and environmental bounds without restarting servers. |
| **7. Federated Learning** | On-device anti-spoof improvement | **Application:** Privacy-preserving model training. Edge devices locally train a logistic classifier on genuine/spoof detections and upload only weight deltas. The central server aggregates these via Federated Averaging (FedAvg). |
| **8. Blockchain Audit Log** | Immutable event ledger | **Application:** Non-repudiation of attendance records. An append-only SHA-256 hash-chain records every state change (e.g., "session_start", "attendance_update"). Any retrospective tampering breaks the chain. |
| **9. Environmental Gating** | Context-aware validation | **Application:** Prevents dark-room or manipulated-environment spoofing. Ambient light (lux) and temperature (Celsius) sensor readings gate AAP accumulation. Out-of-range conditions automatically suspend attendance credits. |
| **10. Session Recovery** | Biometric continuity after gaps | **Application:** Handles occlusion and network drops gracefully. When a student leaves the frame and returns beyond the gap threshold, cosine similarity of stored face embeddings re-links the new detection to the existing session, preventing fragmented records. |

## Patent Claims

**What is claimed is:**

1. **A system for continuous spatial-temporal state accumulation**, comprising a primary object detection layer utilizing bounding-box aspect ratio filtering to enforce human biological structure, a secondary facial recognition layer bound dimensionally inside the primary detection coordinates, and a state-machine database that strictly measures active physical presence accumulation with automatic pause heuristics upon spatial departure.

2. **The system of claim 1**, further comprising a multi-modal biometric fusion module that combines face, iris, and voice confidence scores through a Kalman filter, producing a single gated acceptance signal.

3. **The system of claim 1**, wherein the temporal gap threshold is dynamically computed per entity based on a movement entropy metric derived from body keypoint variance over a sliding window.

4. **The system of claim 1**, further comprising a cryptographic model attestation module that verifies SHA-256 hashes of inference model weights against a sealed registry at service startup.

5. **The system of claim 1**, further comprising a zero-knowledge proof generator that produces Pedersen commitments for each presence window, enabling privacy-preserving auditability.

6. **The system of claim 1**, further comprising a domain-specific language interpreter that loads attendance policy parameters at runtime from a declarative configuration file.

7. **The system of claim 1**, further comprising a federated learning subsystem wherein edge devices train local anti-spoof classifiers and transmit weight deltas to a central aggregation server.

8. **The system of claim 1**, further comprising an append-only hash-chain audit log wherein each attendance event is linked to the previous event via SHA-256, forming a tamper-evident ledger.

9. **The system of claim 1**, further comprising an environmental context gating module that suspends attendance accumulation when ambient light or temperature readings fall outside calibrated sensor bounds.

10. **The system of claim 1**, further comprising a session recovery module that re-links post-gap detections to existing sessions using cosine similarity of stored face embeddings exceeding a configurable threshold.
